Siemens IMA (VB41) CT to DICOM Converter

This project contains a C# tool that converts legacy Siemens CT .ima files (VB41-era, non-standard format) into standard DICOM images using fo-dicom for visualization and analysis.
It was developed through reverse engineering of publicly available file characteristics and empirical validation in Weasis and GIMP.
